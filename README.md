### Repository overview

This repository contains two example Jupyter notebooks using an IPython kernel that were developed for the Tauxe et al., 2016 manuscript on the PmagPy project.

Tauxe, L., R. Shaar, L. Jonestrask, N. L. Swanson-Hysell, R. Minnett, A. A. P. Koppers, C. G. Constable, N. Jarboe, K. Gaastra, and L. Fairchild (2016), PmagPy: Software package for paleomagnetic data analysis and a bridge to the Magnetics Information Consortium (MagIC) Database, Geochem. Geophys. Geosyst., 17, [doi:10.1002/2016GC006307](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016GC006307).



### The notebooks in the repository
One of the notebooks is an illustrative example of taking two data sets from the MagIC database and conducting a variety of analyses on them including a fold test, a common mean test and the calculation of a combined paleomagnetic pole:

The other notebook shows a variety of shorter code examples that put PmagPy functions to use within the notebook environment:

### Using or viewing the notebooks
You can open and interact with these notebooks directly in your browser by clicking the `launch|binder` badge above. ***Please note that this is a temporary notebook and will not save any changes you make to the code.*** To run the code in the notebooks and preserve any changes it is necessary to both download the code from the Github repository and have an installed Python distribution that includes IPython and the other standard scientific python libraries (http://www.scipy.org/). If you followed the directions to install Enthought's Canopy Python distribution that are in the PmagPy cookbook (http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/), you have Jupyter and IPython installed. Type `ipython notebook` or `jupyter notebook` in your command line or open up a notebook in Canopy. There are also good instructions for installing IPython/Jupyter here: http://ipython.org/install.html. 

Alternatively you can view static versions of the notebooks online at these links:
