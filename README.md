Open and reproducible paleomagnetic data analysis in Jupyter notebooks
================================

This repository contains an example Jupyter notebook using an IPython kernel that was developed for the Tauxe et al., 2016 manuscript on the PmagPy project.

**PmagPy: Software package for paleomagnetic data analysis and a bridge to the Magnetics Information Consortium (MagIC) Database**

*L. Tauxe, R. Shaar, L. Jonestrask, N.L. Swanson-Hysell, K. Gaastra, L. Fairchild, N. Jarboe, R. Minnett, A.A.P. Koppers, and C.G. Constable*

To run the code in the notebook it is necessary to both download the code from the Github repository and have an installed Python distribution that includes Jupyter and the other standard scientific python libraries (http://www.scipy.org/). If you followed the directions to install Enthought's Canopy Python distribution that are in the PmagPy cookbook (http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/), you have Jupyter and IPython installed. Just type `ipython notebook` or `jupyter notebook` in your command line or open up a notebook in Canopy. There are also good instructions for installing IPython/Jupyter here: http://ipython.org/install.html. Alternatively you can view a static version of the notebook online with the Jupyter nbviewer at this link:
